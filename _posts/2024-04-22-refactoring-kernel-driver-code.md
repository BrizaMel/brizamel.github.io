As our first contribution to the Kernel, we refactored the code of an IIO driver to address potential memory leaks caused by developers forgetting to release a reference. Additionally, we aimed to enhance error handling clarity. The specific scenario involved a loop within the driver code that required careful attention. Whenever the loop terminated early, a `goto` statement was used to handle the reference release and return. However, we were able to eliminate the `goto` statement by using the `device_for_each_child_node_scoped()` macro, which simplifies the logic while ensuring proper resource management.

We chose this simple task because of our desire to focus on the patch production process rather than the contribution itself. As we faced some challenges to install and compile the Kernel, we opted for a straightforward task that wouldn't demand much time, allowing us to invest more effort into the patch submission process.

Although the required code modification seemed straightforward, we encountered some problems along the way. We ended up discovering that the branch we were working on hadn't been updated since 2022. Consequently, the macro we needed to accomplish the task, `device_for_each_child_node_scoped()`, had not been implemented yet. We looked for an updated branch to develop on, but we were only able to clarify this during class, with the help of the teacher's assistants. Once we found the right branch to develop on, we were able to submit the patch without any further problems.
