To contribute effectively to the Linux Kernel, establishing a secure testing mechanism for the added code is imperative. This can be achieved through the use of a virtual machine to simulate Kernel operations. Thus, the initial step in setting the environment involved creating a virtual machine and managing its access via SSH. Once the machine was configured, I proceeded to work with the Kernel itself. I was pleasantly surprised by the straightforward process of cloning the repository, building the Kernel, and installing its modules and image. I encountered minimal obstacles along the way.

However, integrating my own module into the system proved to be more challenging. Incorporating a new module necessitates modifying a series of settings to integrate it into the Kernel. Overcoming these challenges was facilitated by realizing the need to establish a new directory named `iio_workshop_build`. This directory serves as a clone of `iio_tree`, and we adhere to the principle of installing modules and recompiling the system solely within it. Consequently, `iio_workshop_build` houses our customized Kernel version. It's crucial to ensure the accuracy of all settings within `iio_workshop_build`, as any discrepancies may lead to failure in the process.

One of the mistakes I made in this part was accepting the terminal's suggestion to execute the `make mrproper` command within `iio_workshop_build`. This command inadvertently reset all the settings I had configured. Although the Kernel compiled successfully, it ignored my modifications. It took me some time to comprehend why it was building the old version, only to realize that the `make mrproper` command should be executed within `iio_tree`, not `iio_workshop_build`. Since the settings within `iio_workshop_build` are solely required for testing the new module, overwriting the settings in `iio_tree` is safe.

The remainder of the tutorial proceeded smoothly, and I now feel confident in my ability to add new modules and modify existing ones.
